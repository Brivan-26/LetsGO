# LetsGO: Learn GO in 30 Days

This is my journey on learning GO in 30 days throughout tutorials and hand-on projects. I'm not a fan of watching tutorials, or reading books about technology I have no experience with, that's why I'm following this approach: **Learn by building**. Through out the journey, I used essentialy two references:
- [Learn go by examples](https://gobyexample.com/)
- [Learn go with tests](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests)
  
* Day 0: [Hello, intro into TDD](./Day-0/)
* Day 1: [Integers, Iterations](./Day-1/)
* Day 2: [Arrays, Slices](./Day-2/)
* Day 3: [Structs, Methods, Interfaces](./Day-3/)
